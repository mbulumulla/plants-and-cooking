# Plant your own Produce

Through our final project in Interactive Data Visualization (INFO 4310/5311) we developed 3 visualizations to aid in selecting crops to plant in home gardens for cooking purposes. We utilized [garden data](https://data.world/sharon/vegetables-herbs-and-edible-flowers) and [recipe data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pes12017000148/food-ingredients-and-recipe-dataset-with-images).
